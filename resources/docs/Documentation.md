# Foreword
First, let me say, that you can contact RSS Guard's lead developer via [e-mail](mailto:rotter.martinos@gmail.com) or just submit a ticket here in the repository.

I am glad to accept any kind of donations, see â™¥ **Sponsor** button on the top of this page. **I say "thank you" for all your support, my donators.** Also, I personally send "thank you" to all contributors (translators, source code contributors, issue reporters) and users.

## Philosophy
RSS Guard tends to be independent software. It's free, it's open-source. RSS Guard accepts donations but only as a way of saying "thank you for RSS Guard".

## Versioning
RSS Guard uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). The versioning scheme is `X.Y.Z`, where:

* `X` marks major release version. This number will change very rarely and indicates critical new changes breaking backward compatibility.
* `Y` indicates that there is new major feature available.
* `Z` indicates that there are newly fixed bugs or small features introduced.

## Reporting bugs
Please, report all issues/bugs/ideas to [Issues](https://github.com/martinrotter/rssguard/issues) section. Describe your problem as precisely as possible.

## Localizations
RSS Guard currently includes [many localizations](http://www.transifex.com/projects/p/rssguard).

If you are interested in creating translations for RSS Guard, then do this:

1. Go [here](http://www.transifex.com/projects/p/rssguard) and check status of currently supported localizations.
2. [Login](http://www.transifex.com/signin) (you can use social networks to login) and work on existing translations. If no translation team for your country/language exists, then ask for creating of localization team via the website.

**All translators commit themselves to keep their translations up-to-date. If some translations are not updated by their authors regularly and only small number of strings is translated, then those translations along with their teams will be eventually REMOVED from the project!!! At least 50% of strings must be translated for translation to being added to project.**

## Message filtering
RSS Guard supports _automagic_ message filtering. The filtering system is automatically triggered when new messages for each feed are downloaded. User can write scripts which perform filtering decisions. [**JavaScript with ECMA standard**](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm) is supported.

### Message downloading/filtering workflow
```
foreach (feed in feeds_to_update) do
  messages = download_messages(feed)
  filtered_messages = filter_messages(messages)
  
  save_messages_to_database(filtered_messages)
```
As you can see, RSS Guard processes all feeds scheduled for message downloading one by one; downloading new messages, feeding them to filtering system and then saving all approved messages to RSS Guard's database.

### Writing message filter

Message filter consists of arbitrary JavaScript code which must provide function with prototype `function filterMessage() { }`. This function must be fast and must return integer values which belong to enumeration [`FilteringAction`](https://github.com/martinrotter/rssguard/blob/master/src/librssguard/core/message.h#L83). For example, your function must return `2` to block the message which is subsequently NOT saved into database. For easier usage, RSS Guard 3.7.1+ offers named variables for this, which are called `MSG_ACCEPT` and `MSG_IGNORE`.

Each message is accessible in your script via global variable named `msg` of type [`MessageObject`](https://github.com/martinrotter/rssguard/blob/master/src/librssguard/core/message.h#L118). Some properties are writable, thus allowing you to change contents of the message before it is written to DB. You can mark message important, parse its description or perhaps change author name!!!

RSS Guard 3.8.0+ offers also read-only list of labels assigned to each message. You can therefore do actions in your filtering script based on which labels are assigned to the message. The property is called `assignedLabels` and is array of `Label` objects. Each `Label` in the array offers these properties: `title` (title of the label), `color` (color of the label) and `customId` (account-specific ID of the label).

Passed message also offers special function `MessageObject.isDuplicateWithAttribute(DuplicationAttributeCheck)` which allows you to perform runtime check for existence of the message in RSS Guard's database. The parameter is integer value from enumeration [`DuplicationAttributeCheck`](https://github.com/martinrotter/rssguard/blob/master/src/librssguard/core/message.h#L91) and specifies how exactly you want to determine if given message is "duplicate".

For example if you want to check if there is already another message with same author in database, then you call `msg.isDuplicateWithAttribute(4)`. Enumeration even supports "flags" approach, thus you can combine multiple checks via bitwise `OR` operation in single call, for example like this: `msg.isDuplicateWithAttribute(4 | 16)`.

### Examples
Accept only messages from "Bob" while also marking them important.
```js
function filterMessage() {
  if (msg.author == "Bob") {
    msg.isImportant = true;
    return MSG_ACCEPT;
  }
  else {
    return MSG_IGNORE;
  }
}
```
Replace all dogs with cats!
```js
function filterMessage() {
  msg.title = msg.title.replace("dogs", "cats");
  return MSG_ACCEPT;
}
```
### `Message filters` dialog
The dialog is accessible from menu `Messages -> Message filters` and is the central place for message filters management within RSS Guard. It allows you to:
* add or remove message filters,
* assign filter to whatever feeds (across all accounts) you want,
* rename filters and write their `JavaScript`-based scripts,
* reformat source code of script with `clang-format` tool (which is preinstalled on Windows version of RSS Guard),
* debug your script against sample `MessageObject` instance.

### Performance
Note that evaluations of JavaScript expressions are NOT that fast. They are much slower than native `C++` code, but well-optimized scripts usually take only several miliseconds to finish for each message.

## Database backends
RSS Guard offers switchable database backends which hold your data. At this point, two backends are available:
* MariaDB,
* SQLite (default).

SQLite backend is very simple to use, no further configuration is needed and all your data are stored in single file `<user-data-root-path>\database\local\database.ini`. Check `About RSS Guard -> Resources` dialog to find more info on significant paths used. This backend offers "in-memory" database option, which automatically copies all your data into RAM when app starts and then works solely with that RAM data, which makes RSS Guard incredibily fast. Data is also stored back to database file when app exits. Note that this option should be used very rarely because RSS Guard should be fast enought with classic SQLite persistent DB files.

MariaDB (MySQL) backend is there for users, who want to store their data in a centralized way. You can have single server in your (local) network and use multiple RSS Guard instances to access the data. MySQL will also work much better if you prefer to have zillions of feeds and messages stored.

For database-related configuration see `Settings -> Data storage` dialog.

# Misc
Here you can find some useful insights into RSS Guard's modus operandi.

## Cleaning database
Your RSS Guard's database can grow really big over time, therefore you might need to do its cleanup regularly. There is a dialog `Cleanup database` in `Tools` menu to do just that for you, but note that RSS Guard should run just fine even with thousands of messages.

![`Cleanup database` dialog](images/cleanup-db.png)

## Portable user data
RSS Guard checks "config directory" (this is `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local` directory on Windows) for existence of file:
```
RSS Guard\data\config\config.ini
```
If that file exists, then RSS Guard will use the file (this is called _non-portable **FALLBACK** settings_). If this file is not found, then application will check if its root path (folder, in which RSS Guard executable is installed) is writable, and if it is, it will store settings in it, in subfolder:
```
data\config\config.ini
```
This is _fully-portable mode_. Check `About RSS Guard -> Resources` dialog to find more info on significant paths used.

## Downloading new messages
Here is the rough workflow which is done when you hit `Feeds & categories -> Update all items` or `Feeds & categories -> Update selected items`. At that point of time this happens:
1. RSS Guard creates a list of all/selected feeds.
2. Sequentially, for each feed do:
    * a. Download all available messages from online source.
    * b. Sequentially, for each message do:
        * 1. Sanitize title of the message. This includes replacing all non-breaking spaces with normal spaces, removing all leading spaces, replacing all multiple consecutive spaces with single space. Contents of message are converted from [percent-encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding).
        * 2. Run all [message filters](#message-filtering), one by one, one the message. Cache read/important message attributes changed by filters to queue which is later synchronized back to online feed service.
        * 3. Store the message into RSS Guard's database, creating completely new DB entry for it, or replacing existing message. **Note that two messages are considered as the same message if they have identical URL, author and title and they belong to the same feed.** This does not stand for synchronized feeds (TT-RSS, Inoreader and others) where each message has assigned special ID which identifies the message.

## Generating debug log file
If you run into problems with RSS Guard and you need your problems fixed, you should provide log file from the time when problem occurred. RSS Guard writes all important information to standard output, which is usually calling terminal.

To redirect debug output of RSS Guard to log file, do this:

* Windows
  1. You need to open command line, run `CTRL + R` and write `cmd`.
  2. Navigate to your RSS Guard installation folder, `cd C:\Programs\rssguard\`. This is the folder which contains `rssguard.exe`.
  3. Enter `.\rssguard.exe --log '.\log.txt'`. RSS Guard will now start. You can of course specify arbitrary file where to store log and its location must be writable. The `--log` syntax is supported starting from RSS Guard 3.8.0. Older versions do not support capturing debug output.
  4. Now try to simulate your problem.
  5. Attach generated `log.txt` file to your bug report.

* Linux
  1. You need to open command line, run terminal emulator.
  2. Navigate to your RSS Guard installation folder, `cd /my/root/rssguard'. This step is not usually needed.
  3. Enter `rssguard > /home/<user>/log.txt 2>&1`. RSS Guard will now start.
  4. Now try to simulate your problem.
  5. Attach generated `log.txt` file to your bug report.
